# Fine_Tune_Llama_3_1_unsloth
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a large language model (LLM), specifically Llama 3.1 with 8 billion parameters, using the Unsloth library. Unsloth is a lightweight library designed to simplify the process of training and inference for LLMs, providing support for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and other model optimizations.
